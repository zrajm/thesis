Title: A Writing System<br>for Sign Language?
favicon: js/favicon.svg

<p blank>I can see several directions in which to go, but primarily I want to
stay close to the actual writing systems involved, and write a thesis which
looks at and compares different approaches (and symbols). After thinking about
it for a bit (by writing the below), I think I'm concluding that I'd still like
to write the history of ASLwrite.

* **The history of ASLwrite (specifically) placed into the context of sign
  language writing systems (generally).** – This is the story how the older
  Si5s split into ASLwrite and newer Si5s. Arnold (the original inventor of
  Si5s) continued to develop his system, making use of diacritics to reduce the
  number of handshape symbols (making it easier to learn). But this new
  squigglier look wasn’t universally popular, and a group of devotees of the
  old Si5s system went their own way, called it ASLwrite, and worked to
  regularize the internal features of the characters (without resorting to
  diacritics), while also simplifying the symbols so that they could be written
  by fewer strokes of the pen (making it easier to read), and also dropping
  Arnold’s use of special reduced symbols for WH-questions. (And maybe
  reflection of Si5s origins in Sutton SignWriting, and HamNoSys.)

* **A proposal for how to write Swedish Sign Language.** – What are the
  adaptations required to ASLwrite to fit Swedish Sign Language (STS)? Delving
  into differences between ASL and STS (attitude, mouthings), but also looking
  at other adaptation of Si5s and ASLwrite into Japanese, Vietnamese and
  (possibly) British sign languages. ([Arnold 2007][arnold], [Clark
  2012][clark], [Tanada 2012][tanada] and lots of Facebook posts & other
  internet references)

* **How to write sign language, from a technical perspective. Solving the
  portrayal of sign language on the page.** – Other notation systems? Motion
  writing? Bébian?* *What is writing? What is a good writing system? How does
  it differ from transcription? (Many languages use what was originally a
  transcription system for writing; Klingon, Libras, Skolt Sami.) – Sutton
  SignWriting, HamNoSys description (and critique thereof). – The world’s
  writing systems’ idea of sophisticated vs. unsophisticated invention of
  systems – design considerations for creating writing systems. (Adlam article?
  Conlangs?) [Rosenberg (1995) *Writing Signed Languages*]

* ~~**The benefits of being able to write you mother tongue? (Personally, for a
  Deaf person.)**~~

* ~~**The benefits of being able to write you mother tongue? (For the culture
  you belong to, visibility, acceptance and status in surrounding culture.)**~~

1. Introduction <small>(§1–3)</small>
=====================================

**§1. The world in which the paper is needed.**

<!-- Sign writing is needed for visibility, for learning and for signing people to express themselves -->

There is a dearth of information about sign language in this world. Volumes
have been printed *about,* but not *in* sign language. The perspective of the
signing population (especially those to whom a sign language is the only
language they know) is underrepresented, and far less available, and visible in
the word than their speaking counterparts. Among the hearing, there are many
who are not aware that sign language is in use even in their own home town –
something that would surely change if bilingual street signs also included the
writing of a signed language?


**§2. Introduction to the relevant science.**

*Here I can see one of several directions to go:*
* *The benefits of being able to write you mother tongue? (Personally, for a Deaf person.)*
* *The benefits of being able to write you mother tongue? (For the culture you
  belong to, visibility, acceptance and status in surrounding culture.)*
* *How to write, from a technical perspective. Solving the portrayal if sign
  language on the page. – other notation systems? motion writing? bebian?*


**§3. Introduction to the claim made by the paper.**

→ It is possible to write sign language.


2. Background <small>(§4–8)</small>
===================================
Expansion of §1, citations to everything needed to get started with
understanding the paper.


3. Theory <small>(§9–13)</small>
================================
Expansion of §2, the theoretical points that the results will address.

* “Background” and “Theory” are often combined into a single section.


4. Method <small>(§14–18)</small>
=================================
This section shows:

* How the data were gathered.
* How the data were analyzed.
* Why this was the right way to do it.


5. Results <small>(§19–33)</small>
==================================
Expansion of §3, the actual claims made by the paper.

* Opening paragraph (optional).
* Determine the main claims and subclaims, e.g.
<ul><ul style="margin:-1.5em 1em">
<li>five main claims with 3 paragraphs of support each
<li>12 main claims each supported by one paragraph.
</ul></ul>
* As usual, each paragraph is approximately six sentences in support of a
  single, well-defined claim.
* Concluding summary (optional).


6. Discussion <small>(§34–38)</small>
=====================================
What has changed. 3–5 specific implications following from background, theory
and results, leading to:

* Recommendations for theory: the empirical results show that theory should be
  amended or replaced.
* Recommendations for practice: show how practitioners should more properly act
  upon theory.


7. Conclusion <small>(§39–40)</small>
=====================================
§39. A one paragraph summary of the claim made by the paper, mirroring §3, but
assuming a new shared background with the reader.

§40. The complement of §1 (“before” and “after” pictures of the world that the
research pertains to), based on the Implications section.

* You can think of this as the first paragraph of the next paper.
