<toc>


1. Introduction <small>(§1–3)</small>
=====================================
§1. The world in which the paper is needed.

§2. Introduction to the relevant science.

§3. Introduction to the claim made by the paper.


2. Background <small>(§4–8)</small>
===================================
Expansion of §1, citations to everything needed to get started with
understanding the paper.


3. Theory <small>(§9–13)</small>
================================
Expansion of §2, the theoretical points that the results will address.

* “Background” and “Theory” are often combined into a single section.


4. Method <small>(§14–18)</small>
=================================
This section shows:

* How the data were gathered.
* How the data were analyzed.
* Why this was the right way to do it.


5. Results <small>(§19–33)</small>
==================================
Expansion of §3, the actual claims made by the paper.

* Opening paragraph (optional).
* Determine the main claims and subclaims, e.g.
<ul><ul style="margin:-1.5em 1em">
<li>five main claims with 3 paragraphs of support each
<li>12 main claims each supported by one paragraph.
</ul></ul>
* As usual, each paragraph is approximately six sentences in support of a
  single, well-defined claim.
* Concluding summary (optional).


6. Discussion <small>(§34–38)</small>
=====================================
What has changed. 3–5 specific implications following from background, theory
and results, leading to:

* Recommendations for theory: the empirical results show that theory should be
  amended or replaced.
* Recommendations for practice: show how practitioners should more properly act
  upon theory.


7. Conclusion <small>(§39–40)</small>
=====================================
§39. A one paragraph summary of the claim made by the paper, mirroring §3, but
assuming a new shared background with the reader.

§40. The complement of §1 (“before” and “after” pictures of the world that the
research pertains to), based on the Implications section.

* You can think of this as the first paragraph of the next paper.
