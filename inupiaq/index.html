I’ve here opted use the name *Iñupiaq numerals* (rather than “Kaktovik
numerals” which is common elsewhere) – since this is the name used by
Nuluqutaaq Maggie Pollock, one of the teachers that worked with the system in
the 1990s, in the interview “[Kaktovik numerals preserve Iñupiaq culture
through mathematics](https://youtu.be/T_Xp0hhOp1M)” by Alaska’s News Source.


# Origin

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaktovik_numerals#Origin)
(viewed October 15, 2024):

> The numerals began as an enrichment activity in 1994, when, during a math
> class exploring binary numbers at Harold Kaveolook middle school on Barter
> Island Kaktovik, Alaska, ([Bartley 1997](#bartley-1997)) students noted that
> their language used a base-20 system.
>
> They found that, when they tried to write numbers or do arithmetic with Arabic
> numerals, they did not have enough symbols to represent the Iñupiaq numbers. ([Bartley 2002](#bartley-2002))
>
> They first addressed this lack by creating ten extra symbols, but found these
> were difficult to remember. The small middle school had only nine students so
> the entire school was able to work together to create a base-20 notation. Their
> teacher, William Bartley, guided them. ([Bartley 2002](#bartley-2002))
>
> After brainstorming, the students came up with several qualities that an ideal
> system would have:
>
> 1. Visual simplicity: The symbols should be “easy to remember.”
> 2. Iconicity: There should be a “clear relationship between the symbols and their meanings.”
> 3. Efficiency: It should be “easy to write” the symbols, and they should be able to be “written quickly” without lifting the pencil from the paper.
> 4. Distinctiveness: They should “look very different from Arabic numerals,” so there would not be any confusion between notation in the two systems.
> 5. Aesthetics: They should be pleasing to look at. ([Bartley 2002](#bartley-2002))
>
> In base-20 positional notation, the number twenty is written with the digit for
> 1 followed by the digit for 0. The Iñupiaq language does not have a word for
> zero, and the students decided that the Kaktovik digit 0 should look like
> crossed arms, meaning that nothing was being counted. ([Bartley 2002](#bartley-2002))
>
> When the middle-school pupils began to teach their new system to younger
> students in the school, the younger students tended to squeeze the numbers down
> to fit inside the same-sized block. In this way, they created an iconic
> notation with the sub-base of 5 forming the upper part of the digit, and the
> remainder forming the lower part. This proved visually helpful in doing
> arithmetic. ([Bartley 2002](#bartley-2002))
