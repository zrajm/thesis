   (As opposed to a transcription system)

* Thesis content
** Use "Writing signed languages" "Coffee" example?
** Illustrate all systems in the overview table
   Use one (or a few) different signs: 'world'/'ball' maybe? If multiple,
   choose one with side perspective in ASLwrite, or something on the face? (Maybe all three?)

   Cool to see: Symmetric, but also left-right distinction, and with a body
   place as articulatory placement.
** Pointed syllabics
   Started out as fat lines, then broken lines (in the printing press) then
   eventually pointed. (Parallel to SignWriting – filled in oval for palm =
   transcription, not writing, because impractical.)
** Turn DOI references into links
** Separate reference section into two?
   One for articles describing writing systems (Primary sources for different
   Writing systems?), one for other references.
** Find Source 'SignFont Handbook'
   SignFont
** Si5s at Gallaudet?

   starting in 2012.” (ASLFont 2024)

** Is it possible to write sign language?
   “If the Sign Language is a code, it should be encodable in notation, and
   decodable from notation” (Voegelin 1958: 74)

   Voegelin, C. F. (1958). “Sign language analysis, on one level or two?”
   *International Journal of American Linguistics* 24(1), 71–77.
** Consider Martin 2003 -- Compares Stokoe notation & SignWriting
   This might be interesting for ideas on how to compare multiple writing
   systems and/or evaluate them relative to each other.

** Distinction between writing & transcription
   Even though there exists multiple transcription systems for sign language,
   there are no writing systems in wide use.

   Some good source describing this distinction?
