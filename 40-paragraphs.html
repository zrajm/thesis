Title: 40 Paragraph Outline

<div blank>

Our lecturer (Michael Dunn) teaches Thomas Basbøll’s “[40 Paragraphs]”
principle (intended for academic articles). But since a bachelor’s thesis is
expected to be about the same in size and scope as an academic article, it’s
directly applicable. The following is taken directly from Michael Dunn’s
slides:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Planning and writing

* The paragraph:
* ~200-400 words expressing a single claim along with the information needed to
  support it.
* Takes ~25 minutes to write the first version.
* 30-50 pages @ 500 words / page solid text (less with linguistic examples,
  tables, etc).
* Your outline is basically 40 paragraphs, making 40 substantiated claims.



§§1-3. Introduction
===================

§1. The world in which the paper is needed.

§2. Introduction to the relevant science.

§3. Introduction to the claim made by the paper.


§§4–8. Background
=================
Expansion of §1, citations to everything needed to get started with
understanding the paper.


§§9–13. Theory
==============
Expansion of §2, the theoretical points that the results will address.

* “Background” and “Theory” are often combined into a single section.


§§14–18. Method
===============
This section shows:

* How the data were gathered.
* How the data were analyzed.
* Why this was the right way to do it.


§§19–33. Results
================
Expansion of §3, the actual claims made by the paper.

* Opening paragraph (optional).
* Determine the main claims and subclaims, e.g.
<ul><ul style="margin:-1.5em 1.5em">
<li>five main claims with 3 paragraphs of support each
<li>12 main claims each supported by one paragraph.
</ul></ul>
* As usual, each paragraph is approximately six sentences in support of a
  single, well-defined claim.
* Concluding summary (optional).


§§34–38. Discussion
===================
What has changed. 3–5 specific implications following from background, theory
and results, leading to:

* Recommendations for theory: the empirical results show that theory should be
  amended or replaced.
* Recommendations for practice: show how practitioners should more properly act
  upon theory.


§§39–40. Conclusion
===================
§39. A one paragraph summary of the claim made by the paper, mirroring §3, but
assuming a new shared background with the reader.

§40. The complement of §1 (“before” and “after” pictures of the world that the
research pertains to), based on the Implications section.

* You can think of this as the first paragraph of the next paper.
